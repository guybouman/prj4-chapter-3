	<h1>Sirocco Sky Bar Bangkok</h1>
	<p>The Sirocco & Sky Bar @ Lebua is <strong>Bangkokâ€™s </strong> most famous sky bar. This is partly due to the movie <em>Hangover 2</em> which was shot here. The sky bar is also known by many visitors as The Hangover Sky Bar, The Dome or simply just the name The Sky Bar.<br/> How many names can a bar have? This sky bar is probably on your wish list as well! And that is completely understandable! Lebua is a beautiful sky bar with a magnificent view over the city and the river!
